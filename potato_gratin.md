# Gratinated Potatoes

## Ingredients:
- 1 kg potatoes
- 3 dl heavy cream or milk
- 1 dl grated cheese (or more)
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 0.5 tsp grated nutmeg
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste

### Topping:
- Fresh rosemary

## TODO:
1. Slice potatoes and the garlic.
2. Place the potato slices in a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Sprinkle over the garlic, grated nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Pour in the cream until it just covers the potatoes and bring to a boil.
   **Tip:** Letting the mixture boil for 5 minutes can reduce baking time in the oven.
3. Grease a 20x30 cm baking dish and transfer the potatoes into it. Sprinkle grated cheese on top.
4. Bake in the middle of a preheated oven at 220°C (428°F) for about 20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and golden brown.
5. Garnish with fresh rosemary before serving.

Enjoy your creamy, cheesy gratinated potatoes!
