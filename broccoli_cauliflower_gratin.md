# Broccoli and Cauliflower Gratin

## Ingredients:
- 1 head broccoli
- 1 head cauliflower
- 4 dl milk
- 25g cornstarch
- 25g butter
- 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 150 g grated cheese
- 2 to 3 tbsp panko bread crumbs
- Chopped chives or green onion, for garnish
- Thyme
- Salt
- Ground pepper
- Nutmeg

## Instructions:
1. Clean and cut the cauliflower and broccoli into small florets. Don't forget to use the broccoli stem—peel and slice it.
2. Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the cauliflower and broccoli until tender (about 4-8 minutes, depending on size). Cool in ice water and transfer to a baking dish.
3. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add garlic and thyme, then stir in the flour. Gradually add the milk while whisking. Bring to a boil and let simmer for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. If the sauce is too thin, whisk in a bit more flour.
4. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and grated nutmeg. Pour the sauce over the broccoli and cauliflower in the baking dish.
5. Sprinkle the grated cheese evenly over the dish, then top with panko bread crumbs.
6. Bake in the middle of a preheated oven at 200°C (392°F) for about 20 minutes, or until the surface is golden brown.
7. Garnish with chopped chives or green onions if desired.
