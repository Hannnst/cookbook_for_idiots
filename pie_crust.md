# Pie Dough

## Ingredients:
- 200 g butter
- 300 g all-purpose flour
- 1 dl cold water
- 0.5 tsp salt

## TODO:
1. Crumble the butter and flour together using your fingers until well combined.
2. Add water and salt, then knead the dough quickly until it comes together. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour. This can also be done using a food processor.
3. Let the dough rest for about 30 minutes. (It can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one week.)
4. Sprinkle some flour on your work surface and roll out the dough to about 3 mm thickness.
5. Line a standard pie tin (28 cm) or several small tart molds with the dough.
6. Prick the bottom with a fork, cover with parchment paper, and fill with dry rice, beans, or similar weights.
7. Pre-bake the crust in a preheated oven at 200°C (392°F) for 15 minutes.
